Critical points will show up throughout a majority of this chapter so we first need to define them and work a few examples before getting into the sections that actually use them.
 
||| Definition
We say that $x=c$ is a critical point of the function $f(x)$ if $f(c)$ exists and if either of the following are true.

$f^\prime(c)=0$ OR $f^\prime(c)$ doesn't exist.

Note that we require that $f(c) exists in order for $x=c$ to actually be a critical point.  This is an important, and often overlooked, point.
 
The main point of this section is to work some examples finding critical points.  So, letâ€™s work some examples.
