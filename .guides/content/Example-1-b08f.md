**Example 1**  
Determine all the critical points for the function.

$$f(x)=6x^5+33x^4-30x^3+100$$

**Solution** 
We first need the derivative of the function in order to find the critical points and so let’s get that and notice that we’ll factor it as much as possible to make our life easier when we go to find the critical points.

$f^\prime(x)=30x^4+132x^3-90x^2 $
$=6x^2(5x^2+22x-15) $
$=6x^2(5x-3)(x+5)$

Now, our derivative is a polynomial and so will exist everywhere.  Therefore the only critical points will be those values of x which make the derivative zero.  So, we must solve.

$x=-5,\,\, x=0,\,\, x=\frac{3}{5}$


Polynomials are usually fairly simple functions to find critical points for provided the degree doesn’t get so large that we have trouble finding the roots of the derivative.
